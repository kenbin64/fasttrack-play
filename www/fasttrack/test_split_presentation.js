/**
 * ============================================================
 * READING A CARD 7 SPLIT
 *
 * Reported as: "7 is still a bit clunky when dividing, we need to show what has
 * been chosen on the first split."
 *
 * A split moves two pegs. Both legs used to be handed to the animator in one
 * batch and started in the same tick, so seven holes worth of movement happened
 * at once and there was no way to tell which peg took which half. Leg 2 now
 * waits for leg 1 to land.
 *
 * The split itself stays ONE atomic move. That matters more now that socket
 * play works: the engine still executes a single 'split' and publishes one
 * state, so peers see one move and the turn machine has nothing new to reason
 * about. Only the presentation is staged.
 *
 * What is checked here is the engine side of that contract, plus the wiring in
 * the shipped renderer. How it LOOKS is checked by eye; what cannot drift
 * silently is checked here.
 *
 * Run: node fasttrack/test_split_presentation.js
 * ============================================================
